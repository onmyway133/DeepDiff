**DeepDiff** tells the difference between 2 collections and the changes as edit steps. It also supports [Texture](https://github.com/TextureGroup/Texture), see [Texture example](https://github.com/onmyway133/DeepDiff/tree/master/Example/DeepDiffTexture)

## Usage

### Basic

The result of `diff` is an array of changes, which is `[Change]`. A `Change` can be

- `.insert`: The item was inserted at an index
- `.delete`: The item was deleted from an index
- `.replace`: The item at this index was replaced by another item
- `.move`: The same item has moved from this index to another index

By default, there is no `.move`. But since `.move` is just `.delete` followed by `.insert` of the same item, it can be reduced by specifying `reduceMove` to `true`.

Here are some examples

```swift
let old = Array("abc")
let new = Array("bcd")
let changes = diff(old: old, new: new)

// Delete "a" at index 0
// Insert "d" at index 2
```

```swift
let old = Array("abcd")
let new = Array("adbc")
let changes = diff(old: old, new: new)

// Move "d" from index 3 to index 1
```

```swift
let old = [
  User(id: 1, name: "Captain America"),
  User(id: 2, name: "Captain Marvel"),
  User(id: 3, name: "Thor"),
]

let new = [
  User(id: 1, name: "Captain America"),
  User(id: 2, name: "The Binary"),
  User(id: 3, name: "Thor"),
]

let changes = diff(old: old, new: new)

// Replace user "Captain Marvel" with user "The Binary" at index 1
```

### DiffAware protocol

Model must conform to `DiffAware` protocol for DeepDiff to work. An model needs to be uniquely identified via `diffId` to tell if there have been any insertions or deletions. In case of same `diffId`, `compareContent` is used to check if any properties have changed, this is for replacement changes. 

```swift
public protocol DiffAware {
  associatedtype DiffId: Hashable

  var diffId: DiffId { get }
  static func compareContent(_ a: Self, _ b: Self) -> Bool
}
```

Some primitive types like `String`, `Int`, `Character` already conform to `DiffAware`

### Animate UITableView and UICollectionView

Changes to `DataSource` can be animated by using batch update, as guided in [Batch Insertion, Deletion, and Reloading of Rows and Sections](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/TableView_iPhone/ManageInsertDeleteRow/ManageInsertDeleteRow.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007451-CH10-SW9)

Since `Change` returned by `DeepDiff` follows the way batch update works, animating `DataSource` changes is easy.

For safety, update your data source model inside `updateData` to ensure synchrony inside `performBatchUpdates`

```swift
let oldItems = items
let newItems = DataSet.generateNewItems()
let changes = diff(old: oldItems, new: newItems)

collectionView.reload(changes: changes, section: 2, updateData: { 
  self.items = newItems
})
```

## API Pagination

```swift 

    var itemsList: [Video] = []
    var deepDiffRefreshVideoList: [Video] = [] {
        willSet {
        
            let oldVideos = deepDiffRefreshVideoList
            let changes = diff(old: oldVideos, new: newValue)

            let exception = tryBlock {
                self.collectionView.reload(changes: changes, section: 0, updateData: {
                    self.itemsList = newValue
                }, completion: nil)
            }
            if let exception = exception {
                print(exception as Any)
            }

        }
    }
    
    
    // in your pagination api callback / simply set the above list
    
     func fetchMainFeedTrending() {
           Video.getMostLikeFeed(currentPage).subscribe(
            onNext: { [weak self] videos in
            
              self?.itemsList.append(contentsOf: videos)
              if let arr = self?.itemsList {
                  self?.deepDiffRefreshVideoList = arr
              }
            }
      }
```

Take a look at [Demo](https://github.com/onmyway133/DeepDiff/tree/master/Example/DeepDiffDemo) where changes are made via random number of items, and the items are shuffled.

## How does it work

### [Wagner‚ÄìFischer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagner%E2%80%93Fischer_algorithm)

If you recall from school, there is [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) which counts the minimum edit distance to go from one string to another.

Based on that, the first version of `DeepDiff` implements Wagner‚ÄìFischer, which uses [dynamic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming) to compute the edit steps between 2 strings of characters. `DeepDiff` generalizes this to make it work for any collection.

Some optimisations made

- Check empty old or new collection to return early
- Use `diffId` to quickly check that 2 items are not equal
- Follow "We can adapt the algorithm to use less space, O(m) instead of O(mn), since it only requires that the previous row and current row be stored at any one time." to use 2 rows, instead of matrix to reduce memory storage.

The performance greatly depends on the number of items, the changes and the complexity of the `equal` function.

`Wagner‚ÄìFischer algorithm` has O(mn) complexity, so it should be used for collection with < 100 items.

### Heckel

The current version of `DeepDiff` uses Heckel algorithm as described in [A technique for isolating differences between files](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=359467). It works on 2 observations about line occurrences and counters. The result is a bit lengthy compared to the first version, but it runs in linear time.

Thanks to

- [Isolating Differences Between Files](https://gist.github.com/ndarville/3166060) for explaining step by step
- [HeckelDiff](https://github.com/mcudich/HeckelDiff) for a clever move reducer based on tracking `deleteOffset`

## Benchmarks

Benchmarking is done on real device iPhone 6, with random items made of UUID strings (36 characters including hyphens), just to make comparisons more difficult.

You can take a look at the code [Benchmark](https://github.com/onmyway133/DeepDiff/tree/master/Example/Benchmark). Test is inspired from [DiffUtil](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/util/DiffUtil.html)

### Among different frameworks

Here are several popular diffing frameworks to compare

- [Differ](https://github.com/tonyarnold/Differ) 1.0.3, originally [Diff.swift](https://github.com/wokalski/Diff.swift)
- [Changeset](https://github.com/osteslag/Changeset) 3.0
- [Dwifft](https://github.com/jflinter/Dwifft) 0.8
- [ListDiff](https://github.com/lxcid/ListDiff) 0.1.0, port from [IGListKit](https://github.com/Instagram/IGListKit/)

üí™ From 2000 items to 2100 items (100 deletions, 200 insertions)

```swift
let (old, new) = generate(count: 2000, removeRange: 100..<200, addRange: 1000..<1200)

benchmark(name: "DeepDiff", closure: {
  _ = DeepDiff.diff(old: old, new: new)
})

benchmark(name: "Dwifft", closure: {
  _ = Dwifft.diff(old, new)
})

benchmark(name: "Changeset", closure: {
  _ = Changeset.edits(from: old, to: new)
})

benchmark(name: "Differ", closure: {
  _ = old.diffTraces(to: new)
})

benchmark(name: "ListDiff", closure: {
  _ = ListDiff.List.diffing(oldArray: old, newArray: new)
})
```

**Result**

```
DeepDiff: 0.0450611114501953s
Differ: 0.199673891067505s
Dwifft: 149.603884935379s
Changeset: 77.5895738601685s
